- The [Coral example](https://coral.ai/examples/) projects and the [Coral camera examples](https://github.com/google-coral/examples-camera) give a good overview of what’s possible with the Coral ML accelerator.
- The [OpenCV Python tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) explain how to do all sorts of cool things like machine learning, edge detection, and object tracking.
- The [EarthPy examples](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/index.html) gallery walks you through how to process satellite imagery.
- This [GitHub page](https://github.com/orbitalindex/awesome-space) contains a curated list of space-related resources.
- This [list of annotated satellite datasets](https://github.com/Seyed-Ali-Ahmadi/Awesome_Satellite_Benchmark_Datasets) can be used to train any machine learning models.
- Teams wanting a greater challenge will find a comprehensive resource on aerial and satellite machine learning [here](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#datasets) — be warned that it is quite advanced.

Finally, don’t forget that links to the documentation for each library are available in the Mission Space Lab 23-24 section if you need specific information on how to use a particular library.

**Good luck!**
