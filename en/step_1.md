## Introduction
In this project, you will learn how to enter this year’s Mission Space Lab challenge to calculate the speed of the ISS using the Astro Pis’ sensors and cameras. We’ll provide you with lots of supporting materials to help you write and develop your program, including an example project using historical photos. Then, we’ll help you to adapt and test your program so that it can run for 10 minutes onboard the ISS and produce a value for the speed of the ISS, in real-time. 

This is not a complete step-by-step guide on how to create a program that will solve the problem posed by the challenge. You and your team will need to come up with ideas and solutions and work out how to implement them.

Answers to many of the questions that arise can probably be found by searching online, and we encourage you to do some research and try out different solutions if you get stuck. We’ll also be running a couple of scheduled online webinars where you can ask questions of the team at Astro Pi Mission Control, or you can email us at enquires@astro-pi.org. Don’t be shy - we’d love to hear from you. 
There are a wealth of resources available to help you succeed at every stage of your Astro Pi journey.

If you get stuck, please [contact us](enquiries@astro-pi.org) and we will do our best to help you!

### What you will need to make

Your challenge is to design a program that will have 10 minutes aboard the ISS in which to gather data to estimate the speed. At the end of the 10 minutes, your program must have written a file containing your estimate for the speed of the orbit of the ISS in kilometres per second.

You can use our Astro Pi Replay plugin to simulate your code running live on the Astro Pis on the ISS, and change the program to work in real-time. 

We will also give you information on how to improve the program to make sure it runs smoothly on the ISS in space, while also following the security regulations. 


### What you will need

To complete this project, you will need:
- **A computer running Python 3.9.2 or above.** You can use a Windows, MacOS, or Linux based machine. Instructions for installing Python can be found [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/generic-python-install-python3). A full description of the Astro Pi Python requirements appears later in this guide.
- **Thonny integrated developer environment (IDE).** We recommend you use Thonny as it is easy to use, and is available on Linux, Windows, Mac, and the Raspberry Pi OS. Instructions for installing Thonny are available here.
- **Access to an internet connection.** You will need to access the internet to install the Python packages and to use the Astro Pi Replay plugin, and to submit your program.
